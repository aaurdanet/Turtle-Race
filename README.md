Turtle Racing Game

This Python script simulates a turtle racing game using the Turtle module. Players can bet on a turtle's color and watch them race across the screen.
Setup

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This script utilizes Python's built-in turtle module, so no additional installations are required.
How to Play

  Run the script in a Python environment.
  The game window will appear with turtles lined up on the left side of the screen.
  Enter your bet by typing the color of the turtle you think will win when prompted.
  Once you've placed your bet, the race will begin.
  Sit back and watch the turtles move across the screen.
  If your chosen turtle wins, you'll receive a winning message. Otherwise, you'll be informed that you've lost.

Game Controls

  Close the game window by clicking on the 'X' button or by pressing any key on your keyboard.

Script Details

  The script randomly assigns colors to six turtles and positions them at the starting line.
  Players can bet on a turtle by entering the color of their choice.
  Turtles move forward by a random distance in each iteration of the race loop.
  The race continues until one of the turtles crosses the finish line (x-coordinate > 230).
  After the race ends, the script announces the winning turtle's color and whether the player's bet was correct.

Code Attribution

Enjoy the race! 🐢🏁
